This file demonstrates how to arrange the post content. See the other [examples](.) for
info on the use of markdown itself.

<!-- this is a HTML comment. It can span one line, or several,
     and will not appear in the browser when rendered as HTML -->

A special 'more' comment tag marks the end of content that should be previewed on
the blog index page, and where the 'Read More' link will be shown.

<!-- more -->


## This is a H2 heading

Posts automatically start with the title rendered as a H1 heading.  Therefore, your post
should only use subheadings of level 2 and greater.

The subtitle (or "standfirst") will be shown on the main page, and truncated if longer
than 45 characters. It's inclusion here is optional, as it will normally be written after
the article's submission.


## Page and Site links

Use relative paths for links to page or [post assets](2012-01-04-octopress.md#post-assets).

Use liquid markup to embed a URL to this site: `{{ site.url }}`. This will keep your post
up to date should either move.

Link to [site root]({{ site.url }}) and a [page image](image.jpg).
