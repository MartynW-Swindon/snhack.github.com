of markdown and octopress syntax.

<!-- this is a HTML comment. It can span one line, or several,
     and will not appear in the browser when rendered as HTML -->

A special 'more' comment tag marks the end of content that should be previewed on
the blog index page, and where the 'Read More' link will be shown.

<!-- more -->


## This is a H2 heading

Posts automatically start with the title rendered as a H1 heading.  Therefore, your post
should only use subheadings of level 2 and greater.


## Site links

Use liquid markup to get the URL to this site: `{{ site.url }}`, or the relative path to
this page: `{{ page.url }}`. This will keep your post up to date should either move.

Link to [site root] and a [page image].

[site root]:  {{ site.url }}
[page image]: {{ page.url }}image.jpg
