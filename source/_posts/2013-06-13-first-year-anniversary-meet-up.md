On June 5th we celebrated our 1st year anniversary. Rather than attend a usual meet we decided to relocate the Hackspace to the more informal surroundings of the Sir Daniel Arms for a bite to eat and some drinks.

We met at the Museum between 6:30 and 7pm, left a map to the pub for any late shows before taking the short walk down town. An unusual collection of reprobates we must have looked, but soon realising that we actually fitted in quite well with the other townsfolk. It's cool not to be cool I always tell my kids.

After we arrived in the pub, it was surprisingly busy, with all the tables seemingly taken, but we soon flexed our substantial muscles and hacked together a collection of smaller seats, stools, loungers to make some sort of makeshift eating area.

My simple pub review: Beer was great, prices were very cheap, food was "fine", bartender girl was the most miserable ever, waitress however was nice and chatty.

Those lucky attendees who turned up were rewarded with a hot of the printbed Swindon Hackspace multi-coloured poker chip, worth 1 Gigillion credits, accepted in no respectable establishments worldwide. Even the waitress was curious as to what it was, "a badge of shame" she was told, only surpassed by McDonald's zero stars.

Tony showed a collection of prints from his new Replicator 3D printer. Looking forward to seeing some more.

Conversation was good (from my perspective) many subjects covered not all hackey. We sort of flirted with the following ideas, but nothing as usual in concrete:-

Collaborative Hackspace projects (3D printer).
Visit to Bristol and possibly Oxford Hackspaces.
Contact 1st timers for feedback?
Another publicity drive.
Some web site glitches which need to be discussed with Jamie.

At the end of the evening we tried bouncing some ideas as to the most efficient way to create blog entries onto the Hackspace Website. I understand the [README](https://github.com/snhack/snhack.github.com/blob/master/README.md "https://github.com/snhack/snhack.github.com/blob/master/README.md") file in Github gives instructions on how this is currently achieved, but "easier" being the operative word. Once this is achieved, the hope is that we would have a more variable collection of contributors to the blog with general weekly updates to what has been happening in the Hackspace meets. Therefore scribblings are most welcome from ALL. This is why I was volunteered for this post ;-)

Which leads me to signing off this blog entry with a huge fat disclaimer. It is only my version of events and there were many other discussion topics happening simultaneously, however if there is anything significantly missing then follow the [README](https://github.com/snhack/snhack.github.com/blob/master/README.md "https://github.com/snhack/snhack.github.com/blob/master/README.md") file and see if you can work out how to update this post!!

Congratulations hackspace members on achieving our paper anniversary.
