The Swindon Hackspace formed in June 2012, and started holding [weekly meetings]({{ root_url }}/join) for those interested in making, breaking, and fixing things.  We are a new hackspace, looking to build membership and grow our toolkit.

Members work on a range of projects that usually involve electronic hardware, software programming, and mechanical assembly.  Popular projects often include prototyping electronic circuits using breadboard, and interfacing with [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc), [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) or [Stellaris LaunchPad](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/launchpad/stellaris_head.html) microcontrollers.

Informal sessions are occasionally ran by members; on topics such as [PICAXE](http://www.picaxe.com), Laser Cutting, [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org), and 3D Printing.
