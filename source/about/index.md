The Swindon Hackspace formed in June 2012, and started holding [weekly meetings]({{ root_url }}/join) for those interested in making, breaking, and fixing things.  We are a new hackspace, looking to build membership and grow our toolkit.

Members work on a range of projects that usually involve electronic hardware, software programming, and mechanical assembly.  Popular projects often include prototyping electronic circuits using breadboard, and interfacing with [Arduino], [Raspberry Pi] or [Stellaris LaunchPad] microcontrollers.

Informal sessions are occasionally ran by members; on topics such as [PICAXE], Laser Cutting, [OpenSCAD], and 3D Printing.
