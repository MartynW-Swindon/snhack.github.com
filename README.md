Please see the [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) file for full details on how to build and
preview this site locally.


### Super minimal way to add a post

> Use this workflow when submitting a blog post using standard text or markdown.

Load the [source/_posts] folder and use the [new file] icon above its listing.
Github will automatically fork this project as required.

[source/_posts]: https://github.com/snhack/snhack.github.com/tree/source/source/_posts

Name the new file using your preferred post date and title,
according to the pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-url-safe-title.md`.

[new file]: https://github.com/blog/1327-creating-files-on-github
[naming it]: https://github.com/blog/1436-moving-and-renaming-files-on-github

Enter basic post metadata, followed by your content as plain text or [markdown].
See [this example post] for a template.

[this example post]: https://raw.github.com/snhack/snhack.github.com/source/source/_posts/_examples/2012-11-06-example-post.md
[preview]: https://github.com/snhack/snhack.github.com/blob/source/source/_posts/_examples/2012-11-06-example-post.md

Use the `Propose New File` button to commit the post to a new branch in your fork and
start a pull request.

Ensure the base branch is set to this repo's `source` branch.
Check the `Files Changed` tab, then hit `Send pull request`.

### Notes on Pull Requests

Once you have sent a pull request, an admin will need to build the site locally to
check it renders acceptably and then deploy your content to the live site.

You can view the progress of your pull request in its [discussion thread].
Notifications will normally be sent by email to those active or mentioned
in the thread, as well as those watching either the thread or the related repo.

Additional commits made to the same branch (named with the 'patch' prefix by default)
will automatically be added to the pull request.

For more info on pull requests, please check the [github help] pages.

### Other Notes

Currently, it's only possible to commit plain text when using the github website.

If you're familiar with the use of `git`, feel free to commit the images you want to use,
into a folder named according to the pattern:
`source/_posts/_images/<YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post>/`.

Otherwise, you can attach images to the newly created [discussion thread] for your pull
request.  An admin will then commit them into the correct folder.

The following markdown example will show an image `MyImageFile.jpg`, that has been
uploaded to the folder.

    ![MyImage]({{ page.url }}/MyImageFile.jpg)
